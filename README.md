# 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Malachai Frazier  
### Product-Focused Engineer • Ruby on Rails Veteran • Builder of Beautiful Things (and Strange Ones)

Welcome to my corner of the internet — where code meets creativity, and half-finished ideas eventually find purpose.

I’ve spent 12+ years crafting and scaling full-stack applications with **Ruby on Rails**, **PostgreSQL**, and a mix of front-end frameworks (**React**, **Vue**, **Hotwire**, and a pinch of chaos**).  
I build opinionated systems that feel good to use — because good software should respect your time *and* your sanity.

### ⚙️ I Build Things Like
- MVPs that actually ship (and scale)  
- Tools for humans who still believe in craft  
- Platforms that make collaboration, not consumption, the point  
- Software that doesn’t pretend to be “AI-first,” just *human-friendly*  

---

### 🧰 Toolbox
Ruby • Rails • Postgres • Hotwire • React • Node.js  
Redis • GraphQL • Docker (begrudgingly) • AWS • Heroku  
HTML5 • CSS3 • Bootstrap • Git • Design Thinking • Product Strategy  

---

### 🧠 Currently Exploring
- AI-enhanced creativity and automation for builders  
- Open-source sustainability and decentralized product ecosystems  
- Stoicism as a framework for leadership, focus, and product integrity  
- Writing weird, satirical media that punches up — *[Wake Up, Moron.](https://wakeupmoron.com)* and *[Inferno Times](https://infernotimes.com)*
